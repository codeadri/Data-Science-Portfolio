# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains applied data science and machine learning projects developed as part of a personal learning and portfolio-building journey.  
Each project focuses on solving a real-world problem using structured data, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques.

Currently, the repository includes one completed project described below. Additional projects will be added as separate folders in future updates.

## Project: Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

### Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will cancel their hotel booking based on booking-related attributes such as stay duration, customer behavior, pricing, and booking details.

This is formulated as a **binary classification problem**, where:

- `1` → Booking cancelled  
- `0` → Booking not cancelled  

---

### Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following files:

- `train.csv` – Training data with target variable  
- `test.csv` – Test data with hidden target  
- `sample_submission.csv` – Submission format reference  

The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features related to customer bookings, along with a date feature representing arrival time.
