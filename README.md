# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains applied data science and machine learning projects developed as part of a personal portfolio.  
Each project focuses on solving a real-world problem using structured data, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques.

All projects are organized in independent folders with their own documentation, code, and setup instructions.

## Repository Structure

Each project folder contains:

- A project-specific `README.md`  
- Source code or notebook  
- `requirements.txt` file  
- Local `data/` folder (excluded from GitHub)  

This structure ensures modularity, reproducibility, and clarity across all projects.
